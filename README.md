TURNABOUT
=========

Work in progress. Builds are published
[here](https://adrian.schaedle.me/turnabout/), but not guaranteed to be
in a functioning state.

To develop locally, run `script/server`. It will get you a development server
running at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).
[`src/Main.elm`](http://localhost:9000/src/Main.elm) is the entrypoint into the
game.
